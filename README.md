## The Question
**Is it rude to move to an unsold seat on a plane?** 
 
I chose this question because when I am on an empty flight, I will always move to the window seat, the seat I enjoy the most. I was curious whether or not those surveyed would agree or disagree with my decision. 

## The Chart
The bar chart divides those surveyed into three opinionated groups:
1) No, not rude at all
2) Yes, somewhat rude
3) Yes, very rude 
    
The height of the each bar represents how many of the surveyed individuals agreed with that bar's statement.

## The Results

The data shows that when asked *"Is it rude to move to an unsold seat on a plane?"*, the large majority of individuals answer *"No, not rude at all"*

I found it interesting that there are people who think that moving to an unsold seat is rude.
